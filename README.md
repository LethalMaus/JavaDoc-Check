# JavaDoc-Check

This is a small Maven Project to test Checkstyle checks towards JavaDocs.

The idea is that for any project being completed by multiple developers, a check is in place to make sure they document their code via JavaDocs. The checks are simple enough and per default do not constrict the developers documentation style.

This is also based on the developers using correct variable naming conventions.

Based on the maven-checkstyle-plugin
